# Heart_readmission


📌 Problem Statement

Heart failure is a chronic and progressive condition that remains one of the leading causes of hospital admissions and mortality worldwide. Despite receiving appropriate treatment, a significant proportion of heart failure patients experience unplanned hospital readmissions within 30 days of discharge, increasing the risk of adverse outcomes and imposing a substantial financial burden on patients, families, and healthcare systems.

Early identification of patients at high risk of readmission enables targeted post-discharge interventions, optimized care pathways, and improved clinical outcomes.

🎯 Objective

The objective of this project is to develop a machine learning model that predicts whether a heart failure patient will be readmitted within 30 days of hospital discharge, using structured clinical data from MIMIC-III–style hospital records.
